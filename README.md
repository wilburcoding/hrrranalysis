# HRRRAnalysis

This is a web application that allows users to view the outputs of weather forecasting models.
Data is downloaded from the AWS HRRR database and processed to generate images of certain fields (ex. radar, wind gust, 2 meter temperature), and the web application is used to access these images.
There's a lot of other testing stuff (ex. images for different states, utility) that I'm unable to implement due to RAM and storage limitations on Nest.
